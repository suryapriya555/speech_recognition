**Project Title**
Building an End-to-End Speech Recognition Pipeline: Signal Processing, Acoustic Modeling, and Performance Evaluation
**Description**
# speech_recognition
This project develops a comprehensive speech recognition system tailored for the healthcare domain, enabling accurate and efficient transcription of clinical conversations, doctor-patient interactions, and medical dictations. The pipeline covers all critical stages of speech recognition starting from signal processing .
**Key Features**
Robust noise handling for clinical environments (background noise, equipment sounds).

Custom acoustic models tuned for medical vocabulary and speech patterns.

Support for multiple speakers and accents typical in healthcare settings.

Comprehensive evaluation with healthcare-specific metrics.

**Technologies and Tools**
Python 3.x

Librosa for audio processing

PyTorch and Hugging Face Transformers for acoustic modeling

Scikit-learn and NumPy for data analysis

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and visualization
